Eradiate documentation
======================

*A New-generation Radiative Transfer Model for the Earth Observation Community*

Eradiate is a radiative transfer simulation software package written in Python
and C++17. It relies on a computational kernel based on the
`Mitsuba 2 <https://github.com/mitsuba-renderer/mitsuba2>`_ rendering system
:cite:`Nimier-David2019MitsubaRetargetableForward`.

Eradiate uses Monte Carlo ray tracing integration methods to compute radiative
transfer in scenes consisting of an arbitrary 3D geometry illuminated by an
arbitrary number of light sources, possibly accounting for polarisation.

About
-----

Eradiate's development is funded by a European Space Agency project funded by
the European Commission's Copernicus programme. The design phase was funded by
the MetEOC-3 project.

Eradiate's core development team consists of Yves Govaerts, Vincent Leroy,
Yvan Nollet and Sebastian Schunke.

Eradiate uses as its computational kernel a modified copy of the
`Mitsuba 2 <https://github.com/mitsuba-renderer/mitsuba2>`_ renderer.
The Eradiate team acknowledges all Mitsuba 2 contributors for their exceptional
work.
